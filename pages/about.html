      <div class="texts">
             <p>As such, when the Psychotherapist is emergent, intra-relational, feeling lead and attends to the here and now, the client benefits greatly from the cohesion between their Non ordinary experience and Psychotherapeutic approach, furthering both the depth of Non ordinary experience and breadth of integration.</p>

            <h2>What is top down processing and what is Bottom up Processing?</h2>
      
         <p>To oversimplify, Top down processing sounds like “research suggests 8 glasses of water a day are important” bottom up processing sounds like “I feel thirsty, I am going to get a glass of water” The latter is the expression of an internally lived and organismic regulated truth, these kinds of truths match the phenomenological truths which emerge in Non ordinary states and is why bottom up processing is so important to support.</p>
